    "text": "I am deeply curious about how neural mechanisms support complex cognitive processes such as knowledge and language acquisition, numerical perception, logical reasoning, and memory, particularly from a developmental perspective.\nI aim to explore questions related to how learning disabilities affect these processes and how early identification and intervention can promote more equitable learning outcomes in diverse populations. Through my research, I hope to inform policymakers and improve educational programs to support children’s learning, while addressing their complex developmental needs.\nHere is a link to my LinkedIn, where you can get in touch with me!"
