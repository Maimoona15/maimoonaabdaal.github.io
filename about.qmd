I am deeply curious about how neural mechanisms support complex cognitive processes such as knowledge and language acquisition, numerical perception, logical reasoning, and memory, particularly from a developmental perspective.

I aim to explore questions related to how learning disabilities affect these processes and how early identification and intervention can promote more equitable learning outcomes in diverse populations. Through my research, I hope to inform policymakers and improve educational programs to support children’s learning, while addressing their complex developmental needs.
